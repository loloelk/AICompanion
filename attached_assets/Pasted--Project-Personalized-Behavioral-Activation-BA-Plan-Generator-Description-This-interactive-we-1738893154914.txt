Project: Personalized Behavioral Activation (BA) Plan Generator

Description:
This interactive web application is designed for patients experiencing chronic or treatment-refractory depression. The app collects user data through a series of guided questions and utilizes the ChatGPT-4.0 model to generate a personalized Behavioral Activation plan, including preliminary objectives and SMART goals. The GUI should be simple, clean, and inviting (inspired by modern wellness apps) with subtle animations to create an engaging user experience. In future development, the app may upgrade to a more advanced reasoning model.

Features:
1. A user-friendly interface with clear sections and intuitive navigation.
2. Questions use a hybrid approach: structured inputs (e.g., dropdowns, sliders) and open-ended text fields.
3. Patients can provide up to three preliminary objectives. If they are unable to set objectives, they can skip this section, and the AI will assist in guiding them through objective setting.
4. After submitting the form, responses are compiled into a JSON object and sent to the ChatGPT-4.0 API endpoint (with an option to upgrade to a reasoning model later).
5. The generative AI produces a personalized BA plan that includes reminders and prompts for refining objectives into SMART goals over time.
6. The BA plan is then displayed in a clean and readable format, with options to save or print.

User Data Collection:
The application should prompt the following questions:

--- SECTION 1: Current Mood and Health ---
1. **Mood Rating (Structured):**
   - Question: “On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate your overall mood over the past week?”

    - Input: Text area

12. **Environmental or Routine Barriers (Hybrid):**
    - Question: “Are there any specific aspects of your daily routine or environment that make it difficult to be active? (e.g., lack of time, physical health concerns, limited access to safe outdoor spaces) Please describe.”
    - Input: Dropdown for common options with an accompanying text area for further details

--- SECTION 5: Support and Resources ---
13. **Social Support Network (Open-Ended):**

    - Input: Text area

--- SECTION 6: Goals and Future Aspirations ---
15. **Preliminary Objectives (Hybrid):**
    - Question: “Please list up to three objectives you’d like to work on to improve your mood and activity levels. If you’re unsure, you may skip this step and our AI will help guide you.”
    - Input: Three separate text fields (or allow adding up to three entries) with an option to skip.

16. **Short-Term Goal Setting (Open-Ended):**
    - Question: “What would you like to achieve in the next two weeks in terms of increasing activity or improving your mood? Please be as specific as possible.”
    - Input: Text area

Instructions for the AI Integration:
- Compile the user responses into a JSON object.
- Use a POST request to send this JSON to the ChatGPT-4.0 API endpoint.
  - Note: The code should be modular so that the API endpoint can be switched to a more advanced reasoning model in the future.
- If the user has skipped setting preliminary objectives, include logic for the AI to guide them through objective setting.
- The AI response should generate a personalized BA plan that includes:
  - A review of the user's data,
  - Preliminary (non-SMART) objectives (if provided or guided by the AI),
  - A BA plan with suggested reminders and prompts to eventually refine these objectives into SMART goals.
- Display the AI-generated BA plan on a clean, responsive page. Provide options to save or print the plan.

Additional Implementation Notes:
- The app should use modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a preferred framework such as React or Vue).
- Implement subtle animations (e.g., fade-ins, smooth transitions) to enhance the user experience.
- Ensure the GUI is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- Include error handling for incomplete submissions and provide clear feedback (e.g., loading spinners during the AI API call).
